### Survey_Station_Selection
Goal: to create a better process in selecting survey stations for fisheries and oceaographic work, given differing year to year time constraints and starting locations. Ultimatley, we want to sample in a way that makes data collected comparable to past years, even with variability in sampling time and space.
